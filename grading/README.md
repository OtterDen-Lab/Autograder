Hello!

Since this project is taking on a bigger role than the other tools here I've migrated it to a new repo that can be found [here](https://github.com/samogden/GradingAssistant).  I'll eventually pull in some abstractions and tools, but I think the projects are separate enough that for right now it makes sense to keep them apart.
